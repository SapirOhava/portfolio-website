# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! I built this site using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

## Technologies and Deployment

### Front-end Technologies

The website utilizes **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML** for front-end development. I've incorporated CSS **media queries** to ensure mobile responsiveness, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices. The styling and layout are achieved using CSS to create a visually appealing presentation.

### Logo Design

The logo showcased on the website was crafted using **Canva**, a popular online graphic design tool.

### AWS Hosting and Security

The website's backbone is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here's a breakdown of the AWS services I've employed:

- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: All static files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are stored and served using AWS S3. This service is chosen not only for its reliable storage but also its capability to scale as needed.
- **Route 53**: This DNS service is in place to manage my domain, ensuring that visitors are seamlessly directed to content on AWS S3 when they access the domain.
- **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)**: Security is paramount, so I've secured the website with an SSL certificate from ACM. This guarantees encrypted and safe data exchanges between my server and visitors.
- **CloudFront**: AWS CloudFront, a content delivery network service, has been integrated to enhance content distribution globally, ensuring speedy webpage delivery and enhanced security.
