Welcome to my portfolio website! I built this website using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

**Technologies and Deployment:**

- **Front-end Technologies:** The website is built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for the front-end development. CSS is utilized to style the layout and elements, ensuring an appealing visual presentation.
- **Logo Design:** The logo used on the website is designed using Canva, a popular online graphic design tool.
- **AWS Services:** My portfolio website is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. I use AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) to store and deliver static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, benefiting from its scalable storage capabilities. For managing the domain name and directing traffic to my website hosted on AWS S3, I utilize AWS Route 53, which serves as my DNS (Domain Name System) provider. This seamless integration of AWS services ensures a reliable and efficient web hosting experience.
